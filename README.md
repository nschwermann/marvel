My playground to learn cutting edge libraries and tools using the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started) 
 
 👍 Comments and new issues created are welcomed.


### Summary
 * Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
 * Uses [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) For concurrency and events.
 * Uses many [Jetpack Components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack): Data Binding, LiveData, Navigation, Paging, Room, ViewModel (to name a few).
 * Uses [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) for dependency injection.
 * Uses [Λrrow](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow) for functional types.
 * Built on [MVI Architecture](https://proandroiddev.com/writing-reactive-apps-with-mvi-f7de70739d59)

 <!-- 
  * Uses [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) for image loading.
